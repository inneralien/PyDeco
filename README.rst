PyDeco
======

PyDeco is a template collection of Python files for making command line
scripts. It uses OptionParser and defines some standard options.  It also
incorporates the logging module and defines a NullHandler class. There are
some base Exception classes defined as well.

Why?
    I generate a lot of simple command line scripts and I like to have a 
    consistent interface, so I made this template. I'm sharing it in case
    anyone else would like to use it as well.
